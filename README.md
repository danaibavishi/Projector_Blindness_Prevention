# Projector_Blinding_Prevention
Prototype of a program that aims to prevent blinding when presenting in front of long throw projectors. It used OpenCV, machine learning and pygame to perform pixel deactivation based on the position of the user's eyes. The main challenge this system overcomes is achieving it's objective in a non-intrusive way.
